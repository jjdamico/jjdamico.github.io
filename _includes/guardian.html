<h1>Guardian of My Soul by Joe D'Amico Â© 2020</h1>

In Psalm 91, God promises us protection against evil, even pandemics. The Lord will keep us free from deadly diseases and will spread his wings over us to keep us secure. So we don't need to live in fear, no matter what obstacle life throws at us.
