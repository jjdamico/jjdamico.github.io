<h1>I Will Stand (On the Promises) by Joe D'Amico © 2020</h1>

2 Peter 1:4 says “He (God) has given us His very great and precious promises, so that through these you may be partakers of the Divine nature"(i.e. more like Jesus!). You can depend ('stand') on His word! Jeremiah 1:12 says God "watches over His word to perform (accomplish) it."
